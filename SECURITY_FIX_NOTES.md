## Important Note About @ctrl/tinycolor

### ⚠️ This is a Demo Application

Unguard is an **intentionally insecure** demo application designed to showcase Dynatrace's security monitoring capabilities. The `@ctrl/tinycolor@4.1.1` package reference is part of this demonstration.

### Safe Implementation

The application uses a **local npm registry (Verdaccio)** to serve a **safe simulation** of the malicious package:

1. **Local Registry:** Verdaccio runs at `http://127.0.0.1:4873`
2. **Simulated Package:** Located at `src/frontend-nextjs/vendor/ctrl-tinycolor-sim/`
3. **Safe Behavior:** The simulation mimics malicious behavior but with benign, non-harmful code
4. **Demo Purpose:** Triggers Dependabot alerts and Dynatrace security detections for training purposes

### Configuration

The `.npmrc` file in `src/frontend-nextjs/` is configured to:
```
@ctrl:registry=http://127.0.0.1:4873
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

This ensures `@ctrl/tinycolor` is fetched from the local Verdaccio registry (safe simulation) rather than the public npm registry (actual malicious package).

### Running Safely

To run the application safely:

1. **Start Verdaccio:**
   ```bash
   npx verdaccio --config ops/verdaccio/config.yaml
   ```

2. **Create registry user (first time only):**
   ```bash
   npm adduser --registry http://127.0.0.1:4873
   ```

3. **Publish the simulated package:**
   ```bash
   node ops/verdaccio/publish-tinycolor.js
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend-nextjs
   npm install
   ```

### CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflows automatically:
- Start Verdaccio in a Docker container
- Publish the safe simulation package
- Build the application using `--network host` to access the local registry

See `.github/workflows/src-ghcr-build.yml` for details.

## Breaking Changes

### Swagger UI React (4.19.1 → 5.29.4)
This is a major version upgrade that may include breaking changes. Review:
- API documentation rendering
- Custom styling or theming
- Integration with next-swagger-doc

### Next.js (15.0.4 → 15.5.5)
Minor version update within Next.js 15. Should be backward compatible but verify:
- Server Actions functionality
- Image optimization behavior
- Development server behavior
- Cache configuration

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] No new TypeScript errors
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger) renders correctly
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Timeline features work (posts, likes, follows)
- [ ] Image uploads work
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No security warnings from npm audit (except @ctrl/tinycolor demo)

## Monitoring and Validation

### Dynatrace Validation
After deployment, verify in Dynatrace:
1. No new HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities detected
2. CVE-2025-49826 no longer reported
3. CVE-2024-3566 no longer reported
4. Security events show resolved vulnerabilities
5. Application performance remains stable

### Query to Validate Fix
```dql
fetch security.events, from:now() - 1h
| filter event.type == "VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"
| filter vulnerability.references.cve in ["CVE-2025-49826", "CVE-2024-3566"]
| dedup {vulnerability.display_id, affected_entity.id}, sort: {timestamp desc}
| filter vulnerability.resolution_status == "OPEN"
| summarize count = count(), by: {
    vulnerability_id = vulnerability.display_id,
    cve = vulnerability.references.cve,
    service = entityName(dt.entity.service)
}
```

This query should return **0 results** after the fix is deployed and Dynatrace has rescanned.
