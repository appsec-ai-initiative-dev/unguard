- **Last Detected:** 2025-09-24T09:50:39.737Z

### Affected Entities
- **Entity Name:** server.js (next-js-frontend) unguard-frontend-*
- **Entity ID:** PROCESS_GROUP-EAE7D4CE3B29873F
- **Total Affected Entities:** 1

### Davis Security Assessments
- **Vulnerable Function Status:** NOT_AVAILABLE
- **Public Internet Exposure:** ‚úÖ **YES - PUBLIC_NETWORK**
- **Public Exploit Available:** ‚ùå NO
- **Data Assets Within Reach:** ‚ùå NO

### Severity Analysis
‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY** - This vulnerability has a Davis risk score of 8.7 and the affected service is **exposed to the public internet**. While the vulnerable function status is not available and no public exploit has been detected, the public exposure of this HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability makes it a critical security concern.

### Impact
HTTP Request Smuggling can allow attackers to:
- Bypass security controls
- Poison web caches
- Hijack user sessions
- Access unauthorized content
- Perform request routing attacks

## Vulnerability #2: Command Injection (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### Vulnerability Details
- **Display ID:** S-206
- **Title:** Command Injection
- **CVE Reference:** CVE-2024-3566
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.6 (frontend), 8.8 (user-auth-service)
- **Davis Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Last Detected:** 2025-09-24T09:51:39.704Z

### Affected Entities
This vulnerability affects **2 services** in the unguard application:

#### Frontend Service (PRIMARY CONCERN)
- **Entity Name:** server.js (next-js-frontend) unguard-frontend-*
- **Entity ID:** PROCESS_GROUP-EAE7D4CE3B29873F
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.6

**Davis Security Assessments:**
- **Vulnerable Function Status:** NOT_AVAILABLE
- **Public Internet Exposure:** ‚úÖ **YES - PUBLIC_NETWORK**
- **Public Exploit Available:** ‚úÖ **YES - EXPLOIT AVAILABLE**
- **Data Assets Within Reach:** ‚ùå NO

#### User Auth Service (ALSO AFFECTED)
- **Entity Name:** bin/www (user-auth-service) unguard-user-auth-service-*
- **Entity ID:** PROCESS_GROUP-0E654D040B91D2A5
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.8

**Davis Security Assessments:**
- **Vulnerable Function Status:** NOT_AVAILABLE
- **Public Internet Exposure:** ADJACENT_NETWORK
- **Public Exploit Available:** ‚úÖ **YES - EXPLOIT AVAILABLE**
- **Data Assets Within Reach:** ‚úÖ **YES - DATA REACHABLE**

### Severity Analysis
üö® **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - This vulnerability has the following critical characteristics:
1. **Davis risk score of 8.6-8.8** (HIGH severity)
2. **Public exploit is available** - Attackers have ready-to-use tools
3. **Public internet exposure** on the frontend service
4. **Data assets are reachable** from the user-auth-service
5. **Loaded and running** in production processes

### Impact
Command Injection vulnerabilities can allow attackers to:
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Gain full control of the server
- Access sensitive data
- Pivot to other systems
- Install malware or backdoors
- Exfiltrate data

## Critical Finding: Runtime Confirmation

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Both vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Dynatrace RVA as **loaded and running in production processes**. This is significantly more critical than vulnerabilities found only in dependency scans (like Dependabot), as it confirms:

1. The vulnerable code is **actively loaded in memory**
2. The vulnerable libraries are **part of the running application**
3. The attack surface is **real and exploitable**
4. The risk is **immediate and present**

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Investigate CVE-2025-49826 (HTTP Request Smuggling)**
   - Identify the vulnerable package/dependency
   - Check if this is related to Next.js or a dependency
   - Review `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for affected packages

2. **Investigate CVE-2024-3566 (Command Injection)**
   - Identify the vulnerable package/dependency
   - Determine which npm package is affected
   - Check both frontend and user-auth-service dependencies

3. **Apply Security Patches**
   - Update affected packages to patched versions
   - Test thoroughly in development environment
   - Deploy to production urgently

4. **Implement Temporary Mitigations** (if patches unavailable)
   - Add WAF rules to detect/block HTTP request smuggling attempts
   - Implement input validation for command injection vectors
   - Consider rate limiting and enhanced monitoring

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)
1. Enable continuous monitoring for these CVEs
2. Review application logs for signs of exploitation
3. Conduct security audit of the affected services
4. Implement enhanced logging and alerting

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)
1. Implement automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
2. Establish security patching SLA
3. Regular security training for development team
4. Implement defense-in-depth strategies

## Technical Investigation Required

To remediate these vulnerabilities, the following investigation is needed:

1. **Dependency Analysis:**
   ```bash
   # Check for packages related to CVE-2025-49826
   npm audit
   npm ls | grep -i <vulnerable-package>
   
   # Check for packages related to CVE-2024-3566
   npm audit
   ```

2. **Review Next.js Version:**
   - Current version: 15.0.4
   - Check if Next.js itself is affected or if it's a dependency

3. **Review Other Dependencies:**
   - axios: 1.8.4
   - cheerio: 1.0.0-rc.12
   - swagger-ui-react: 4.19.1
   - Other packages that might be vulnerable

---

## Additional Context

- **Repository:** unguard
- **Service Type:** Next.js Frontend Application
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes (based on k8s-manifests presence)
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Node Version:** 20.5.7 (from devDependencies)
