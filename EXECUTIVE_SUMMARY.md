# Critical Vulnerability Investigation - Executive Summary

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT üö®

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Service:** frontend-nextjs (unguard application)  
**Severity:** HIGH (2 vulnerabilities)  
**Status:** Active and Exploitable

---

## Key Findings

Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics (RVA) has identified **2 HIGH severity vulnerabilities** affecting the frontend-nextjs service that are **currently loaded and running in production processes**.

### Vulnerability #1: HTTP Request Smuggling
- **ID:** S-248
- **CVE:** CVE-2025-49826
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.7 (HIGH)
- **Affected Process:** server.js (next-js-frontend) unguard-frontend-* [PROCESS_GROUP-EAE7D4CE3B29873F]
- **Public Internet Exposure:** ‚úÖ YES (PUBLIC_NETWORK)
- **Public Exploit Available:** ‚ùå NO
- **Vulnerable Function in Use:** NOT_AVAILABLE
- **Data Assets Reachable:** ‚ùå NO

### Vulnerability #2: Command Injection üö®
- **ID:** S-206
- **CVE:** CVE-2024-3566
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.6 (frontend), 8.8 (backend)
- **Affected Processes:**
  1. server.js (next-js-frontend) unguard-frontend-* [PROCESS_GROUP-EAE7D4CE3B29873F]
  2. bin/www (user-auth-service) unguard-user-auth-service-* [PROCESS_GROUP-0E654D040B91D2A5]
- **Public Internet Exposure:** ‚úÖ YES (PUBLIC_NETWORK on frontend)
- **Public Exploit Available:** üö® YES - CRITICAL
- **Vulnerable Function in Use:** NOT_AVAILABLE
- **Data Assets Reachable:** ‚úÖ YES (from user-auth-service)

---

## Why This Is Critical

### 1. Runtime Confirmation
These vulnerabilities are **NOT just dependency issues**. Dynatrace RVA has confirmed that the vulnerable code is:
- ‚úÖ Loaded in memory
- ‚úÖ Running in production processes
- ‚úÖ Part of the active application

This makes them **immediately exploitable**, unlike vulnerabilities that exist only in unused dependencies.

### 2. Public Internet Exposure
Both vulnerabilities affect services exposed to the **public internet** (PUBLIC_NETWORK), making them accessible to any external attacker without needing internal network access.

### 3. Exploit Availability
**CVE-2024-3566** (Command Injection) has a **public exploit available**. This means:
- Attackers have ready-to-use tools
- No specialized knowledge required to exploit
- Active exploitation may already be occurring
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### 4. Potential Impact

**CVE-2025-49826 (HTTP Request Smuggling):**
- Bypass security controls and authentication
- Poison web caches
- Hijack user sessions
- Access unauthorized content
- Perform request routing attacks

**CVE-2024-3566 (Command Injection):**
- Execute arbitrary system commands
- Gain full control of the server
- Access sensitive data
- Pivot to other internal systems
- Install malware or backdoors
- Exfiltrate data

## Additional Critical Issues

npm audit revealed **17 additional vulnerabilities**, including:

### üî• CRITICAL: Malware Detected
- **Package:** @ctrl/tinycolor version 4.1.1
- **Issue:** Malicious code injected in versions 4.1.1-4.1.2
- **Action Required:** IMMEDIATE REMOVAL

### Other High-Priority Issues
- **Next.js** (15.0.4): Multiple critical vulnerabilities (DoS, SSRF, Cache Poisoning, Authorization Bypass)
- **axios** (1.8.4): DoS vulnerability
- **dompurify**: XSS vulnerabilities

## Dynatrace Integration

All findings are based on Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics queries:

```dql
fetch security.events
| filter dt.system.bucket=="default_securityevents_builtin"
     AND event.provider=="Dynatrace"
     AND event.type=="VULNERABILITY_STATE_REPORT_EVENT"
     AND event.level=="ENTITY"
| dedup {vulnerability.display_id, affected_entity.id}, sort:{timestamp desc}
| filter vulnerability.resolution.status == "OPEN"
     AND vulnerability.parent.mute.status != "MUTED"
     AND vulnerability.mute.status != "MUTED"
     AND (contains(affected_entity.name, "frontend") OR contains(affected_entity.name, "nextjs"))
```

---

## Success Metrics

Resolution will be considered complete when:
- [ ] All HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities resolved
- [ ] CVE-2025-49826 remediated or mitigated
- [ ] CVE-2024-3566 remediated or mitigated
- [ ] Malware package removed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Application functioning normally
- [ ] Dynatrace confirms vulnerabilities no longer present in running processes
- [ ] No new vulnerabilities introduced

---

## Investigation Methodology

This investigation used:
1. **Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics (RVA)** - Primary source for vulnerability detection
2. **npm audit** - Supplementary dependency vulnerability scanning
3. **Manual code review** - Package.json and dependency analysis
4. **CVE database research** - Background on specific vulnerabilities

The key differentiator of this investigation is the use of Dynatrace RVA, which confirms vulnerabilities in **running processes**, not just in dependency manifests.
