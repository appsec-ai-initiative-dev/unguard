**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Overview

This document provides a detailed remediation plan for the critical vulnerabilities identified by Dynatrace Runtime Vulnerability Analytics affecting the unguard frontend-nextjs service.

---

## Vulnerabilities Summary

| ID | Title | CVE | Risk Score | Risk Level | Exploit Available | Public Exposure |
|----|-------|-----|------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| S-248 | HTTP Request Smuggling | CVE-2025-49826 | 8.7 | HIGH | No | Yes (PUBLIC) |
| S-206 | Command Injection | CVE-2024-3566 | 8.6 | HIGH | **Yes** | Yes (PUBLIC) |

---

## Critical Factors

### Why These Vulnerabilities Are Critical

1. **Runtime Confirmation**: Both vulnerabilities are confirmed as **loaded and running** in the production process `server.js (next-js-frontend)`. This is not just a dependency issue - the vulnerable code is actively in memory.

2. **Public Internet Exposure**: Both vulnerabilities affect a service exposed to the public internet (PUBLIC_NETWORK), making them immediately exploitable by external attackers.

3. **Exploit Availability**: CVE-2024-3566 has a **public exploit available**, meaning attackers have ready-to-use tools to exploit this vulnerability.

4. **High Risk Scores**: Both vulnerabilities have Davis risk scores above 8.5, placing them in the HIGH severity category.

## Vulnerability #1: CVE-2025-49826 (HTTP Request Smuggling)

### Technical Details
- **Vulnerability Type:** HTTP Request Smuggling
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.7
- **Affected Entity:** server.js (next-js-frontend) - PROCESS_GROUP-EAE7D4CE3B29873F
- **Public Internet Exposure:** YES
- **Exploit Available:** NO
- **Vulnerable Function in Use:** NOT_AVAILABLE

### Potential Root Causes

HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerabilities typically occur in:

1. **Next.js Server** (version 15.0.4)
   - Next.js has had several HTTP-related vulnerabilities in recent versions
   - Could be in the server middleware or request parsing

2. **HTTP Parsing Libraries**
   - Could be in Node.js's http module
   - Could be in proxy/middleware components

3. **Reverse Proxy Configuration**
   - Mismatch between frontend (Next.js) and backend HTTP parsing
   - Could involve envoy-proxy service

### Remediation Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Within 24 hours)
1. **Verify Next.js Version:**
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend-nextjs
   npm ls next
   # Current version: 15.0.4
   # Check if CVE-2025-49826 affects this version
   ```

2. **Check for Next.js Security Advisories:**
   - Visit https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories
   - Search for CVE-2025-49826 or HTTP Request Smuggling issues

3. **Review npm audit output:**
   - The audit shows Next.js has multiple critical vulnerabilities
   - Consider upgrading to Next.js 15.5.5 or later

4. **Implement WAF Rules:**
   - Add rules to detect HTTP request smuggling patterns
   - Monitor for suspicious request headers
   - Look for:
     - Conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers
     - Requests with both CL and TE headers
     - Malformed chunk sizes

#### Short-term Actions (Within 1 week)
1. **Update Next.js:**
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend-nextjs
   # Backup current state
   git checkout -b security-patch-nextjs
   
   # Update Next.js to latest stable version
   npm install next@latest
   
   # Run tests
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

2. **Review HTTP Configuration:**
   - Check Next.js configuration in `next.config.js`
   - Review any custom server configuration
   - Ensure proper HTTP header handling

3. **Test Thoroughly:**
   - Test all application functionality
   - Perform security testing
   - Check for regression issues

#### Long-term Actions
1. Set up automated security scanning
2. Implement HTTP request validation
3. Regular dependency updates
4. Security code reviews

## Vulnerability #2: CVE-2024-3566 (Command Injection)

### Technical Details
- **Vulnerability Type:** Command Injection
- **Davis Risk Score:** 8.6 (frontend), 8.8 (user-auth-service)
- **Affected Entities:**
  - Frontend: server.js (next-js-frontend) - PROCESS_GROUP-EAE7D4CE3B29873F
  - Backend: bin/www (user-auth-service) - PROCESS_GROUP-0E654D040B91D2A5
- **Public Internet Exposure:** YES (frontend), ADJACENT_NETWORK (backend)
- **Exploit Available:** **YES** ⚠️
- **Data Assets Reachable:** YES (from user-auth-service)

### Potential Root Causes

Command injection vulnerabilities in Node.js applications typically occur in:

1. **Package Dependencies:**
   - Check all packages that execute shell commands
   - Common culprits: child_process wrappers, build tools, file processors

2. **Specific Packages to Investigate:**
   - **cheerio** (1.0.0-rc.12) - used for HTML parsing, could have command execution issues
   - **swagger-ui-react** (4.19.1) - has known vulnerabilities
   - **next-swagger-doc** (0.4.1) - custom package that might execute commands
   - Any package using `child_process`, `exec`, or `spawn`

3. **Application Code:**
   - User input passed to shell commands
   - File operations with user-controlled paths
   - Build scripts or code generation

### Research CVE-2024-3566

1. **Search Online Databases:**
   - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3566
   - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3566
   - https://github.com/advisories

2. **Check Affected Package:**
   ```bash
   # Search for the CVE in npm advisory database
   npm audit --json | jq '.vulnerabilities | to_entries[] | select(.value.via[].source == "CVE-2024-3566")'
   ```

### Remediation Steps

#### Critical Actions (Within 12 hours)
⚠️ **This vulnerability has a public exploit - immediate action required!**

   npm install axios@latest
   
   # Update other critical packages
   npm audit fix
   npm audit fix --force  # If needed for breaking changes
   ```

2. **Check User Auth Service:**
   ```bash
   cd src/user-auth-service
   # Same vulnerability affects this service
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Review Application Code:**
